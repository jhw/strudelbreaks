# strudelbreaks

Reusable plumbing for Strudel breakbeat templates — a seeded RNG, a
Pico-style sequence class, mini-notation helpers, monotonic density
masking, hex formatters, corner-panel UI chrome, and a schema-gated
persisted store. Distributed over jsDelivr as a single UMD file; no
build step, no npm publish.

The namespace is breakbeat-agnostic despite the repo name: any Strudel
gist that needs deterministic generation, a corner HUD, or
localStorage-backed captures can consume the same library.

## Usage

```js
const SB_URL = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jhw/strudelbreaks@main/breaks.js';

async function loadStrudelBreaks(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const prev = document.getElementById('strudelbreaks');
    if (prev) prev.remove();
    const s = document.createElement('script');
    s.id = 'strudelbreaks';
    s.src = url;
    s.onload = () => resolve(window.StrudelBreaks);
    s.onerror = reject;
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  });
}

const SB = await loadStrudelBreaks(SB_URL);
```

Thereafter:

```js
const rng = SB.rng.mulberry32(22682);
const seq = SB.pico.PicoSequence.random(rng, 16);
const panel = SB.ui.createCornerPanel({ corner: 'bottom-right', id: 'log' });
panel.setText('patch: ABCD');
```

## Namespace

```js
window.StrudelBreaks = {
  rng:   { mulberry32, randInt, randChoice, sampleUnique },
  pico:  { PicoSequence, SEQUENCE_MODES },
  mini:  { parseBreak, parsePattern, formatBreak, formatPattern },
  util:  { meanIndex, thinByUniforms },
  hex:   { hex2, hexPad, arrayHex },
  ui:    { createCornerPanel, createButton, createIconButton, createDeleteIcon, createButtonBar, createSliderRow, createSliderPanel, resetUI },
  store: { createPersistedStore, downloadBlob },
};
```

See `breaks.js` for the per-function contracts; the tests under
`tests/` double as executable documentation.

### rng

- `mulberry32(seed)` — returns a deterministic `() => number` in `[0, 1)`.
- `randInt(rng, min, max)` — integer in the inclusive range.
- `randChoice(rng, arr)` — one element of `arr`.
- `sampleUnique(rng, draw, { count, sig })` — rejection-samples `count`
  distinct items (dedup by `sig(item)`); throws after `count * 100`
  attempts if the space is exhausted.

### pico

`PicoSequence` models an Erica Synths Pico SEQ: a short list of slice
indices played back through one of five modes (`forward`, `reverse`,
`ping_pong`, `ping_pong_repeat`, `random`). `withMode` / `withTranspose`
return fresh clones. `PicoSequence.random(rng, nSlices, opts)` builds a
short contiguous-with-interval run such as `[3, 5, 7]`.

### mini

- `formatBreak(names, { eventsPerCycle })` → `{name name ...}%N`
- `parseBreak(str)` → `[name, name, ...]`
- `formatPattern(steps, { restChar = '~' })` → `[index index ~ index]`
- `parsePattern(str, { restChar = '~' })` → `[index | null, ...]`

Round-trip faithful. Consumers work in structured arrays and serialize
at the edge (for Strudel's `mini()` / `fmap(mini).innerJoin()` dance).

### util

- `meanIndex(xs)` — mean of a list, `0` on empty. Used as a sort key so
  shape-major browsing moves through different regions of the source.
- `thinByUniforms(shape, uniforms, probability)` — keeps exactly
  `round(probability * shape.length)` slots: those with the lowest
  `uniforms[i]` (ties broken by index). Stepwise monotonic: sweeping
  `probability` up adds slots one at a time without ever removing, so
  the rhythmic shape is preserved across levels. The survivor count is
  exact — no Binomial variance.

### hex

- `hex2(v)` — two-digit uppercase hex (`v | 0` byte).
- `hexPad(v, width)` — uppercase hex padded to `width`.
- `arrayHex(arr, { restChar = '~' })` — single-digit hex per element,
  `restChar` for `null` entries.

### ui

- `createCornerPanel({ corner, id, style?, stack? })` →
  `{ element, setText }`. Creates (or reuses, by `id`) a fixed-position
  monospace green-on-dark div and pins it to one of
  `top-left | top-right | bottom-left | bottom-right`. Append children
  to `element` for richer panels; use `setText` for plain-text HUDs.
  `stack: <otherPanelId>` stacks this panel adjacent to an
  already-rendered sibling (above the ref for bottom corners, below it
  for top corners) with the same 10px gap used at the corner edge —
  so stacked blocks have consistent spacing whether they grow down
  from the top or up from the bottom. The ref panel must already have
  its final content at call time; measurement is one-shot.
- `createButton(label, onClick, { style? })` → `HTMLButtonElement` with
  the house style.
- `createIconButton(glyph, onClick, { hoverBg?, hoverColor?, disabled?, style? })` →
  a small single-glyph span inside a dark-grey circle. Hover colours
  are caller-supplied so the same primitive covers destructive (red)
  and neutral (green) actions; defaults are red-on-hover. When
  `disabled`, the button renders dimmer, takes no click, and shows no
  hover response — callers still render it so layout stays stable at
  list boundaries (e.g. a `<` move-left arrow on the first cell of a
  row). Uses `inline-flex` centring so plain ASCII glyphs (`<`, `>`,
  `x`) land optically centred regardless of font baseline quirks.
- `createDeleteIcon(onClick, { style? })` → red-hover `x` preset over
  `createIconButton` for destructive actions. No confirmation is
  wired — callers handle that at the domain layer.
- `createButtonBar({ corner, id, style?, stack?, buttons })` →
  `{ element }`. Thin convenience over `createCornerPanel` with a
  flex row and tighter bar-style padding. `buttons` is an array of
  pre-built elements (typically from `createButton` /
  `createIconButton`) appended in order. Lets a template split its
  toolbar into multiple independently-stacked bars rather than
  cramming every control into a single panel.
- `createSliderRow({ label, min, max, initial?, step?, onChange, format?, width? })` →
  `{ element, setValue, getValue }`. Flex row: label + readout +
  native `<input type=range>`. `format(v)` renders the readout
  (defaults to decimal); `width` pins the readout width in `ch`.
  `onChange(v|0)` fires on user drag; `setValue(v)` syncs thumb +
  readout without firing `onChange`, so a caller that already owns the
  authoritative value can snap without feedback loops.
- `createSliderPanel({ corner, id, style?, stack?, rows, format? })` →
  `{ element, rows, setAll }`. Corner panel containing N slider rows
  keyed by `row.key`. A panel-level `format` applies to every row, and
  the panel computes a uniform readout width from it so all rows
  align on the left edge of the range input. `setAll({ key: value, … })`
  snaps every named row at once. `stack` forwards to
  `createCornerPanel` — useful for stacking the slider panel above or
  below another corner-anchored block. Thin convenience over
  `createCornerPanel` + repeated `createSliderRow`.
- `resetUI()` — removes every DOM node the library has attached.
  Templates should call this once after loading StrudelBreaks so
  widgets from a previously-pasted script don't linger. Every element
  created by `createCornerPanel` / `createButton` is tagged with
  `data-strudelbreaks="1"`; self-contained templates that don't load
  the library can do the same sweep inline:
  `document.querySelectorAll('[data-strudelbreaks]').forEach(el => el.remove())`.

No knowledge of patches, breaks, or captures — those live in the
consuming template.

### store

- `createPersistedStore({ key, schemaVersion, defaultPayload })` →
  `{ get, set, clear, exportAsFile }`. `get()` returns the parsed
  payload when `payload.schema === schemaVersion`; on a mismatch it
  logs a warning and returns `null`. `set` / `clear` round-trip
  through `localStorage`. `exportAsFile(filenamePrefix)` downloads
  the current payload as a timestamped JSON file.
- `downloadBlob(filename, content, mimeType?)` — browser-only helper
  used by `exportAsFile`.

## CDN URL

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jhw/strudelbreaks@main/breaks.js?_=${Date.now()}
```

The `@main` ref + `?_=${Date.now()}` query param keeps the consumer on
the latest commit and busts jsDelivr's cache on every eval. Dev mode —
no version pinning.

## Export targets

Tempera (`tempera.strudel.js`) persists captures to `localStorage` and
exports them as a JSON payload. `scripts/export/` turns that payload
into device-specific formats:

| Target | Output | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `octatrack/` | OT project zip — one bank per row, one pattern per cell | [docs/export/octatrack.md](docs/export/octatrack.md) |
| `ot-doom/` | OT project zip — megabreak-of-doom matrix chains | [docs/export/ot-doom.md](docs/export/ot-doom.md) |
| `torso-s4/` | Torso S-4 sample bundle — one WAV per row | [docs/export/torso-s4.md](docs/export/torso-s4.md) |
| `strudel/` | Standalone `.strudel.js` playback template | [docs/export/strudel.md](docs/export/strudel.md) |

Common shape:

```
python scripts/export/<target>/render.py <export.json> [--name NAME] [--seed N] [--source {json,wav}]
```

### Source mode (`--source`, audio targets only)

The Strudel sample gist now publishes both `name.wav` (the
breakbeat) and `name.json` (a [beatwav](https://github.com/jhw/beatwav)
pattern that re-synthesises the breakbeat from one-shot drum samples).
Pick the source per export:

- **`json`** (default) — fetch each break's beatwav JSON, render to
  WAV at the captures' BPM and the device's native sample rate
  (44.1 kHz for OT, 96 kHz for S-4). Tempo is correct by
  construction; no resample-on-load; closes the OT's latent
  48-kHz-source drift hole.
- **`wav`** — bundle the gist's WAVs as-is. Necessary for older
  WAV-only gists; per-break fallback when JSON mode finds no sibling
  JSON.

JSON mode pulls one-shots from the `wol-samplebank` S3 bucket
(`s3://wol-samplebank/samples/`) and mirrors them to `tmp/oneshots/`
on first use via `aws s3 sync` — needs AWS credentials with read on
the bucket. The shared resolver, cache layout, and fallback rules
live in `scripts/export/common/sample_source.py`. Per-device sample
rates live in `scripts/export/common/devices.py`.

The `strudel/` target is a JS template generator, not an audio
renderer — it has no `--source` flag. The generated `.strudel.js`
loads WAVs at runtime via `samples(gistUrl)`, exactly like
`tempera.strudel.js`.

## Tests

JS library — `node:test`, zero deps, runs under Node 18+:

```
npm test
```

Python export targets — stdlib `unittest`, requires the `requirements.txt`
deps installed in a venv (`beatwav`, `octapy`, `pydub`). See
`docs/export/` for per-target documentation:

```
npm run test:py
```

Or both at once: `npm run test:all`.

CI at `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs the JS suite on every push / PR
to `main`.

Coverage:
- JS: every pure helper (`rng`, `pico`, `mini`, `util`, `hex`, and
  the `store` primitive behind a localStorage stub). `ui` primitives
  are deliberately not unit-tested — thin wrappers over
  `document.createElement` whose only real failure mode is a
  blank-page smoke test.
- Python: pure helpers per render target plus a round-trip smoke
  test that synthesises an export, runs the renderer end-to-end
  with stubbed manifest/sample fetches, and asserts on the output
  artefact. The renderers' I/O surfaces (gist fetch, audio rendering)
  are stubbed out at the function level rather than mocked deeper.

## Demo

`tempera.strudel.js` at the repo root is a thin breakbeat template
that loads this library from jsDelivr and drives it with four sliders
(`rootBreak`, `altBreak`, `pattern`, `prob`) plus a live `delay`
control. Paste it into [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) to jam.
